# React Split Test

A/B Experiment component that allows for simple split tests to be run in a React application. Experiments can also be nested to run mutually exclusive multi-variate experiments.

## Batteries not included
This package does not come transpiled - the importing library is responsible for setting proper browser targets and transpilation options.
